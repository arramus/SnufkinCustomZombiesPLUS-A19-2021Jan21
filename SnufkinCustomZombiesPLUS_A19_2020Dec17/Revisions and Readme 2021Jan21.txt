21st of January 2021 - Snufkin Custom Zombies PLUS (A19)
========================================================

Snufkin Custom Zombies PLUS is a combination of Snufkin's Server Side Custom Zombies and additional community made zombies as a 'Plus Add On'. Attempting to launch the base mod and Plus Add On separately caused instability with base mod spawn groups and it was necessary to compile them.

1. Snufkin's Server Side Custom Zombies (In alphabetical order)

- Archon
- Banshee
- Bomber
- Cowhead

INSTALLATION
============
For players and server hosts who have never installed a mod before.
If you've never installed a mod before it is necessary to create a mod folder in the main directory or in an area suggested by your server host if they have modified the installation. Simply make a new folder called Mods (with a capital M to reflect standard nomenclature). If you drag the mod folder directly out of the zipped file it can be placed directly into the Mods folder and the game will look in there as you launch your World. If you allow your unzip function to extract the folder, it may make another unnecessary folder and place the mod inside it. This will not be recognised by the game/server if you place it in the Mods folder like this. Please take it out of the extra folder level. The top layer will be a single folder and in the second layer you will see a ModInfo.xml file with or without additional folders depending on the mod. This will become elementary once you've launched a few mods.

Does this Mod need to be installed in the server/client host? = YES
Do players also need to install this Mod? = NO

The magic of this mod is that is only needs to be installed in the server/person who has launched the main environment that others join. It is a technical work of art. Enjoy.

CREDITS
=======
Apart from Snufkin who created the base mod, there are so many names to mention because it was a real community effort from modders, server administrators, and players whose requests were certainly acted on. You can see the history and contributors in the forum thread at 7daystodie.com.
